SHELL DESIGN
============

The BOS shell should operate at a minimum resolution of 80*25, but prefarably on more.
It should be tile-able to allow different apps to run in different parts of the window, such
as a "graphical" file browser might use up all but one line at the bottom for commands.

The mouse or keyboard interrupts will be used to switch between active tile, giving that
areas program full control. Simulating multitasking to some degree.

The built in scripting language needs support to set up screen resolution, tile areas,
and more on boot.

Programs should provide minimum resolution requirements if not text based scrolling
is all it needs.

Pop-ups with kernel panics or dialogs could cover any area.

The shell scripting language will allow a few special case script-files called in an
event like fashion.  If .RUN is the default script exstension, AUTO.RUN would be used
at boot. EXIT.RUN when exiting/rebooting, NOTFOUND.RUN to parse commands not understood
and provide shortcuts for builtin commands. Cron like functionality for other
scripts to be scheduled.

GUI apps using build in functions for borders, pop-ups and such will scale perfectly
from 80*25 textmode all the way to some VESA mode with polished graphics, like 1024*768.
